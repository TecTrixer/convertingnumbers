# Change between number systems
With this python program you can convert numbers to various number systems like binary, hexa and many more. It uses the python version 3.7 but probably works with other ones too. Make sure that all files are in the same directory because otherwise there will be an error.

# Contributing to this project
If you want you can add different number systems to the .csv file. That would be great. But note that the first 3 columns are being used to define the number system. If you add your own number system you also need to add your definition there because otherwise it will not work.
